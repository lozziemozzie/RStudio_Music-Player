# RStudio_Music Player
 Code to make R Studio play music!

Packages you will need for this project:
"dplyr",
"audio",
"ggplot2" (ggplot2 is optional if you want to visualise your music frequencies in a violin plot)
#
This repository is still in progress, so should be updated fairly soon with some more songs, and I'm working on some code to make music input easier in relation to freq ~ duration
